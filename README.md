# Building Containers from Scratch in Go

This is a toy container build from scratch in Go solely for learning purpose. It uses namespaces and cgroups, mount a tmpfs that's isolated from host filesystem.

## What it does

*Before starting, you'll have to download and unzip the content of `manjaro_fs.zip` file present in the drive link provided inside `Prerequisite.txt`. This will create a subdirectory called `manjaro_fs` which will be mounted as our container's root directory.*

You'll have to be inside a Linux machine (Manjaro in my case) to try this.

This will start our container (needs root privilege for creating `cgroup`):
```
sudo su
go run main.go run /bin/bash
``` 

Alternatively (Doesn't need root privilege but omits `cgroups`):
```
go run main.go runRootless /bin/bash
```

It will:
- Fork itself with `CLONE_NEWUTS`, `CLONE_NEWPID`, `CLONE_NEWNS` flags with isolated hostname, processes and mounts
- The forked process will create `cgroup` to limit memory usage of itself and any child process it creates
- Mount `./ubuntu_fs` directory as root filesystem using `chroot` to limit access to host machine's filesystem
- Mount `/mytemp` directory as tmpfs. Any change made to this directory will not be visible from host.
- Mount proc (where `CLONE_NEWPID` namespace was already set) so that container can run `ps` and see only the processes running inside it.
- Execute the supplied argument `/bin/bash` inside the isolated environment

PS: the contents of `manjaro_fs.zip` file has been extracted from Arch-Linux docker image (using `docker export...` command). You'll find entire log inside `Filesystem_Chroot_Setup.txt` file. :)
